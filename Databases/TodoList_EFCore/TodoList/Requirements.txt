Please Create a new solution of Asp.net core MVC web app project.

You will be creating a Shop management application:

Main requirements:

The application should have 2 pages:
List ShopItems -> Should List all items in a nicely formatted table.
Add ShopItem -> Should be able to add a new items (it should display to index after).
In 'List ShopItems' you should able to delete.

ShopItems should have name, shopName and ExpiryDate.


------------------------------------------------------------

Modify your application to use SQL server and EF CORE ORM.


Addition Requirements:
1. The 'Add new shopitem' form should use bootstrap and be nicely formatted
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/
2. 'Edit ShopItem' functionality:
	Add new button 'Edit' which is an ActionLink.
3. Study: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/


-----------------------------------------------------------------

Implement the same functionality with Shop.
Shop should have Name and Id
You should be able to List, Add, Delete Shop.
Shop should have a foreign constraint to ShopItem (one - to -many ).
Shop has many shopitems while shopitem has a single shop.

Additional Requirements:
1. Implement dropdown in Add ShopItem.
2. List Shops also should display ShopItems (I leave for you to figure how)
There should be extra column which displays all shopitems separated by ';'
